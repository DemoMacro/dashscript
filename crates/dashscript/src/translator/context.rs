//! Type context threaded through expression translation.
//!
//! DashScript reuses `oxc` for parsing and linting, but `oxc`'s Rust layer has
//! no type checker (its type-aware linting runs in a separate Go binary). So a
//! `.ds` program's types come from the annotations the author wrote, which we
//! record as we walk declarations and statements. `Ctx` carries that record
//! into the expression layer so type-sensitive mappings — `x === null` →
//! `x.is_none()`, `a ?? b`, enum construction, array callbacks — can decide
//! without a full type checker.
