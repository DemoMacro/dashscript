//! Canonical knowledge of the ES global built-ins DashScript models — sourced
//! once here so the translator's dispatch and the `check.rs` translatability lint
//! agree, instead of each keeping its own string list (which drifts: a name added
//! to one path but not the other is a silent misclassification).
//!
//! DashScript models these globals only as a static-call/new receiver
//! (`Math.floor`, `Array.isArray`, `new Map()`) or a type annotation (`Map<K,V>`)
//! — never as a first-class value. A bare value reference (`Array` as a value,
//! `var f = Object.keys`) is reflection the static TS→Rust mapping cannot
//! express; detecting it is [`is_static_only_global`].

/// Globals usable *only* as a static-call/new receiver or type annotation. A
/// bare reference to one as a value is unsupported — the translator would
/// snake-case the name (`Array`→`array`) and emit a phantom binding (E0425
/// `partial`). `Number`/`String`/`Boolean` are intentionally absent: they carry
/// mapped static members read as values (`Number.MAX_VALUE`→`f64::MAX`) and a
/// prototype-borrow form (`String.prototype.trim.call(x)`), so blanket-flagging
/// the name would regress those. Their conversion-call form (`Number(x)`) is
/// covered by `global_function`. `RegExp` is included: its call/new forms
/// (`RegExp(pat)`, `new RegExp(pat)`) are mapped, but it has no static *value*
/// members — a bare reference is always reflection (`RegExp.prototype.X`,
/// `RegExp.length`) the static mapping cannot express, so it routes to the
/// engine rather than emitting a phantom `reg_exp` binding. `Function` is
/// included for the same reason: the `Function` constructor has no DashScript
/// mapping (dynamic function creation is reflection), so a bare reference
/// (`Object.getOwnPropertyNames(Function)`, `Function.prototype.X`) routes to
/// the engine instead of emitting a phantom `function` binding. `Date` is
/// included for the same reason: DashScript models Temporal (not `Date`), so
/// the `Date` constructor has no mapping, and a bare reference (`Date.now`,
/// `Date.prototype.X`) routes to the engine rather than emitting a phantom
/// `date` binding.
