# DashScript benchmarks

Microbenchmarks comparing **DashScript** (`ds`, TypeScript → native Rust) against
**node** (V8), **bun** (JSC), and **perry** (also TypeScript → native), all
running the identical TypeScript source. Each bench is one algorithm written
once: `main.ds` is DashScript's entry (it lowers to Rust `fn main`), `main.ts`
runs unchanged under node / bun / perry with a trailing `main()`.

The kernel selection mirrors perry's `benchmarks/` — the polyglot single-
language kernels and the Node/Bun compute kernels — so the same algorithms
perry compares against Node/Bun are compared against DashScript here.

## Run

```bash
# all benches, every available runtime (ds / node / bun / perry)
node examples/bench/run.mjs

# a subset
node examples/bench/run.mjs fib array-ops

# more samples, or pin specific runtimes
BENCH_SAMPLES=11 BENCH_RUNTIMES=ds,node,bun node examples/bench/run.mjs
```

The harness writes `results.json` (median + raw samples, machine-readable) and
prints a table. **Every row is gated on the stdout checksum matching across
runtimes** — a fast time from a build that returned the wrong answer is flagged
`✗ MISMATCH`, never reported as a win. A runtime slower than `ds_median + 30s`
per sample is killed and marked `T/O`, so one pathologically slow runtime
cannot block the suite.

## Methodology

**What is timed.** Wall-clock per process launch, median of `BENCH_SAMPLES`
(default 5) runs.

- **ds** — `ds build` produces `dist/<name>(.exe)`; the timed process is the
  prebuilt native binary — pure native execution, no `cargo` on the hot path.
- **node** / **bun** — `node main.ts` / `bun main.ts`; the timed process
  includes VM startup (V8 / JSC init), exactly what any `node script.ts`
  invocation pays.
- **perry** — `perry compile` produces a native binary, timed the same way as
  ds.

`main.ds` deliberately has no `Date.now()` — the bench output is a pure
checksum — so all runtimes are measured by the same external yardstick: the
time a real `<runtime> script` invocation takes end to end. Every bench
`console.log`s a single value that depends on the full computation; a runtime
that returns a different value flags the row `✗`, because a perf number
without correctness is worthless.

## Results

<!-- Updated by `node run.mjs` — re-run to refresh. Lower wall-clock median is better. -->

_All times wall-clock ms per process launch, median of 5 samples. Measured
2026-07-20, Windows 11, ds 0.0.0 / node v24.18.0 / bun 1.3.6 / perry (native).
`results.json` holds the raw per-sample numbers._

_The single `✗` is **`int-add`**, and it is perry's deviation, not
DashScript's: the 1e9-iteration sum reaches ~5×10¹⁷, past 2⁵³ where f64 loses
integer precision. `ds` / `node` / `bun` all return the ES-correct
`499999999067109000` (f64); `perry` computes the sum as **i64** and returns
`499999999067108992`. DashScript matches node/bun — the row is flagged only
because the cross-runtime checksum gate refuses to silently endorse a
divergence. (`int-add` annotates the accumulator `let sum: number = 0` so
DashScript's number-flavor inference keeps it `f64`; without the annotation
Phase 1 would promote it to `i64` and return the exact — but non-ES, since an
ES `number` is `f64` — `499999999500000000`.)_

_`perry` on `loop-data-dependent` is `T/O`: its optimizer cannot fold the f64
recurrence, and a single sample runs past the `ds_median + 30s` ceiling._

## Interpretation

- **Numeric / allocation-free (`fib`, `factorial`, `mandelbrot`,
  `method-calls`, `primes`, `binary-trees`, `closure`)** — `ds` leads 2.4–4.4×:
  zero-overhead native code, no JIT warmup, no boxing. `factorial` joins this
  group after number-flavor inference (Phase 1) promoted its counter and
  accumulator to `i64` — `sum += i % 1000` is now pure integer arithmetic (no
  `f64` modulo); the sum stays under 2⁵³, so `i64` matches ES `f64` exactly.
- **`loop-data-dependent`** — `ds` now leads (1383 vs node 1478, vs bun 1464).
  The earlier gap was the bitwise **index** `x[i & 63]` round-tripping through
  `f64` (`(__a & __b) as f64 … as usize`): the `f64` intermediate both cost a
  conversion per access and, worse, hid the `& 63` range from LLVM so the `Vec`
  bounds check could not be elided (V8 elides it). Emitting the masked result
  straight to `usize` restored the elision. The `sum = sum*x[i&63] + …`
  recurrence is not the bottleneck — it is a sequential hazard either way.
- **`levenshtein`** — `ds` now matches node (153 vs 152). The Myers bit-vector
  inner loop is dominated by the `as i64 as i32` cast chain each bitwise op
  emits (JS `ToInt32` wrap), which a future Phase 2 may shorten by promoting
  the bit vectors to `i64`.
- **Array kernels (`array-read`, `array-write`, `nested-loops`, `object-create`,
  `array-ops`)** — `ds` leads 1.5–1.8× on reads and matches bun on writes:
  Rust's bounds-check elimination handles the sequential pattern, and
  `__ds::array_set` is `#[inline]`, so the optimizer folds the ES auto-grow
  path.
- **`matrix-multiply`** — `ds` leads (72 vs node 149). The kernel writes its
  result through a `&mut Vec` reference parameter (`matmul(a, b, &mut c)`), so
  the caller sees the mutation with no clone — ES reference semantics lowered
  correctly.
- **`str-concat`** — `ds` leads (22 vs node 116). `s = s + "x"` lowers to Rust
  `String + &str`, whose growth is amortized-O(1) doubling.
- **`string-ops`** — the three runtimes are within ~10 ms (152–161): the
  workload is dominated by `slice` reallocation and `indexOf` scanning, where
  V8/JSC and Rust are all allocator-bound.
